# Workflows Directory

Most workflows have been consolidated into `/commands/` for direct invocation.

## Remaining Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `release.md` | Release preparation and deployment (10 steps) |
| `security-audit.md` | Comprehensive security assessment (8 steps) |

## For Other Workflows

Use the corresponding command instead:
- Feature development → `/full-feature`
- Bug fixes → `/quick-fix`
- Refactoring → `/refactor-clean`

See `.claude/commands/README.md` for the full command directory.
