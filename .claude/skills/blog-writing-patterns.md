# Blog Writing Patterns for SAT Content

Authoritative patterns for creating engaging, educational SAT preparation blog content.

## Content Structure

### Standard Blog Post Template

```markdown
---
title: "Compelling, Clear Title"
category: SAT Prep
tags: [specific, relevant, searchable]
readingTime: 5-7
---

# Main Title (H1)

**Hook**: Start with a relatable question, surprising fact, or common problem.

## Introduction

- Set context (1-2 paragraphs)
- Preview what reader will learn
- Why this matters for SAT success

## Main Content (H2 Sections)

### Section 1: Clear Subtopic

- Use concrete examples
- Include actionable tips
- Break down complex concepts

### Section 2: Another Subtopic

- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 lines)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Add emphasis with **bold**

## Practical Examples

### Example 1

Provide real SAT-style scenarios:
- Show the problem
- Walk through the solution
- Explain the reasoning

## Common Mistakes (Optional)

- What students get wrong
- Why they make these mistakes
- How to avoid them

## Summary/Key Takeaways

- Recap main points (3-5 bullets)
- Reinforce the value
- Provide next steps

## Call to Action

- Encourage practice
- Link to related resources
- Invite questions/comments
```

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone and Voice

**DO**:
- Write conversationally ("you" and "your")
- Use contractions (don't, you'll, it's)
- Sound encouraging and supportive
- Be enthusiastic but not over-the-top
- Address reader directly

**DON'T**:
- Use academic jargon without explanation
- Talk down to students
- Be overly formal or stiff
- Use corporate speak
- Make assumptions about knowledge

### Complexity and Clarity

**Keep It Accessible**:
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- Define SAT-specific terms on first use
- Use analogies and metaphors
- Break complex ideas into steps

**Example**:
```
BAD: "The utilization of process of elimination methodology facilitates
the expeditious identification of incorrect answer choices."

GOOD: "Process of elimination is your friend. By crossing out obviously
wrong answers, you narrow down your choices and boost your odds of
getting it right."
```

### Paragraph Structure

- **Length**: 2-5 sentences ideal
- **One idea per paragraph**
- **Topic sentence first**: State the main point
- **Supporting details**: Evidence, examples, explanation
- **Transition**: Connect to next paragraph

### Lists and Formatting

**Use Bullet Points For**:
- Steps in a process
- Multiple examples
- Quick tips
- Key takeaways

**Use Numbered Lists For**:
- Sequential steps
- Ranked items (top 5, etc.)
- Instructions that must be followed in order

**Use Bold For**:
- Key terms and concepts
- Important warnings
- Emphasis on critical points

**Use Italics For**:
- Gentle emphasis
- Technical terms (first mention)
- Thoughts or internal dialogue examples

## Engagement Techniques

### Strong Openings

**Question Hook**:
> "Ever feel like you're reading the passage but nothing's sticking?
> You're not alone, and I've got the fix."

**Problem Statement**:
> "You've circled three answers, erased twice, and you're still not
> sure. Sound familiar? Today we're fixing that."

**Surprising Fact**:
> "Here's something most students don't know: the SAT Reading section
> isn't actually testing your reading speed."

**Relatable Scenario**:
> "It's 10 PM the night before the SAT, and you're panicking about
> vocabulary. Let's talk about what actually matters."

### Active Voice

**DO**: "Answer the line reference questions first."
**DON'T**: "Line reference questions should be answered first."

**DO**: "Circle what the question asks for."
**DON'T**: "What the question asks for should be circled."

### Concrete Examples

**Abstract** (Bad):
> "Time management improves performance outcomes."

**Concrete** (Good):
> "Budget 13 minutes per reading passage. That's enough time to read
> carefully and answer all 10-11 questions without rushing."

### Encouraging Language

Replace negative framing with positive:

| Negative | Positive |
|----------|----------|
| "Don't forget..." | "Remember to..." |
| "You might struggle with..." | "This takes practice, but..." |
| "This is really hard..." | "This is challenging, and here's how to tackle it..." |
| "If you fail to..." | "When you..." |

## SAT-Specific Patterns

### Evidence-Based Advice

**Always Link to SAT Reality**:
- Reference official SAT materials
- Use authentic question types
- Cite College Board guidelines
- Share score improvement data (if available)

**Example**:
> "According to the College Board, the Reading Test includes exactly
> one literature passage. That means you can predict what's coming and
> prepare specifically for it."

### Practical Application

**Show, Don't Just Tell**:

```markdown
## Strategy: Process of Elimination

❌ Bad: "Use process of elimination to find answers."

✅ Good:
### Strategy: Process of Elimination

Let's try it with a real example:

**Question**: The author's tone can best be described as:
A) Harshly critical
B) Mildly skeptical
C) Enthusiastically supportive
D) Completely neutral

**Step 1**: Eliminate extremes
- Cross out A (too harsh) and D (never completely neutral)

**Step 2**: Look for evidence
- Check passage for skeptical language → Found it!
- No overwhelming enthusiasm → B is our answer

See how that worked? Now you try with the next question.
```

### Address Common Concerns

Students worry about:
- Time pressure
- Vocabulary
- Hard passages
- Trick questions
- Score improvement

**Acknowledge and Address**:
```markdown
"Worried about time? You should be—but in a good way. Time awareness
is different from time panic. Here's how to manage it without stress..."
```

## Quality Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] **Clear value proposition**: Reader knows what they'll learn
- [ ] **Actionable advice**: Specific steps, not vague suggestions
- [ ] **Concrete examples**: Real scenarios, not abstract concepts
- [ ] **Accurate information**: Verified against official SAT materials
- [ ] **Engaging tone**: Conversational, encouraging, supportive
- [ ] **Proper structure**: Logical flow, clear sections, good formatting
- [ ] **SEO optimized**: Keywords in title, tags, headers
- [ ] **Proofread**: No typos, grammar errors, or awkward phrasing
- [ ] **Mobile-friendly**: Short paragraphs, good use of whitespace
- [ ] **Call-to-action**: Clear next step for reader

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### ❌ Information Overload

Don't try to cover everything in one post. Focus on one strategy, one
concept, or one type of mistake.

### ❌ Lack of Specifics

Vague advice like "study hard" or "practice more" doesn't help. Give
concrete, actionable steps.

### ❌ Ignoring the Reader

Don't write what YOU want to say. Write what the READER needs to know.

### ❌ Talking Down

Students are smart. Don't oversimplify or sound condescending.

### ❌ Unsubstantiated Claims

"This strategy will raise your score 200 points!" needs evidence or
should be toned down.

### ❌ Wall of Text

Break up long paragraphs. Use headers, lists, and formatting.

## Examples of Effective Patterns

### Pattern 1: Problem-Solution

```markdown
## The Problem

You're running out of time on the Reading section. You finish 3 passages
easily but rush through the last 2 and miss easy questions.

## Why This Happens

Most students don't have a time budget. They spend too long on passages
1-3, leaving no time for 4-5.

## The Solution

Budget 13 minutes per passage. Set mental checkpoints:
- Minute 13: Move to passage 2
- Minute 26: Move to passage 3
- Minute 39: Move to passage 4
- Minute 52: Move to passage 5

Use a watch. Mark your progress. Stick to the schedule.

## Practice This

Time your next 5 practice passages. Note when you go over 13 minutes.
Adjust your reading speed, not your thoroughness.
```

### Pattern 2: Step-by-Step Tutorial

```markdown
## How to Tackle Evidence-Based Questions

These two-part questions look scary, but follow this process:

### Step 1: Answer the First Question

Read the question. Find your answer in the passage. Don't look at
answer choices for question 2 yet.

### Step 2: Find Your Evidence

Look at question 2's choices. Which excerpt supports YOUR answer?

### Step 3: Verify the Match

Does your choice from question 1 match your evidence from question 2?

### Step 4: If They Don't Match

Go back to question 1. One of the other answers probably works with
your evidence.

### Example

[Provide real example with questions and passage]
