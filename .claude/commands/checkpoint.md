# Checkpoint Command

Run all automated quality checks as a single unified verification gate.

---

## Usage

```
/checkpoint
/checkpoint --skip-build
/checkpoint --skip-security
```

---

## What This Command Does

Runs a progressive pipeline of automated quality checks, auto-detecting available tools in your project:

1. **TypeScript**: `tsc --noEmit` (if tsconfig.json exists)
2. **Lint**: ESLint, Ruff, go vet, Clippy (auto-detected)
3. **Format**: Prettier, Black, gofmt, rustfmt (auto-detected)
4. **Tests**: vitest, jest, pytest, go test, cargo test (auto-detected)
5. **Build**: `npm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build` (auto-detected)
6. **Security**: `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit` (auto-detected)
7. **Traceability**: `verify-traceability.sh` (if spec exists in `.claude/plans/`)
8. **Mutation Testing**: Stryker (if stryker.conf exists — optional)

Each step reports PASS/FAIL with timing. All steps run even if earlier ones fail, giving you a complete picture.
